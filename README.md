# Counting Sort Demo

A JavaScript demo of [counting sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort)
that I've written mainly as an exercise in visualizing algorithms and to accompany a [blog post](https://www.abdnh.net/counting-sort) I had been writing.

## TODO
- tidy up the code

Inspired by this great site for visual demonstrations of algorithms and data structures: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/

They have a counting sort demo too (I copied part of its layout): https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/CountingSort.html
