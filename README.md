# Counting Sort Demo

A JavaScript demo of [counting sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort)
that I've written mainly as an exercise in visualizing algorithms and to accompany a blog post I'm currently working on.

## TODO
- tidy up the code
- add link to blog post when it's finished
- add option to switch display language to Arabic since the blog post is in Arabic

Inspired by this great site for visual demonstrations of algorithms and data structures: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/

They have a counting sort demo too (I copied part of its layout): https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/CountingSort.html
